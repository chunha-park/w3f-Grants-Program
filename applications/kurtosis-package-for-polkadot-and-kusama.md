## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

This project aims to implement environment definitions through [Kurtosis package](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/packages) for Polkadot and Kusama. The Kurtosis services and API are designed to simplify the process of deploying various nodes and services in development, testing and production environments eliminating complicated steps and minimizing dependencies. This package will serve as a one stop solution for all the node deployments across the substrate ecosystem. It will be capable of setting up nodes, development and testing utilities, such as chopstick and zombienet, explorers, and can be extended to support bridges.

### Project Details

#### Technologies

- [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/): Kurtosis is a platform for packaging and launching environments of containerized services ("distributed applications") with a focus on approachability for the average developer. What Docker did for shipping binaries, Kurtosis aims to do even better for distributed applications.
- [Starlark](https://docs.kurtosis.com/starlark-reference): Starlark is a dialect of Python intended for use as a configuration language. Starlark is used as DSL for creating environment definitions in Kurtosis which helps in sharing and reusing distributed application components.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/):
Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

#### Supporting Implementations

- [D.I.V.E](https://github.com/HugoByte/DIVE): A powerful toolkit designed to streamline the entire process of node setup, network configurations, smart contract build and deployment currently supporting Ethereum, Cosmos and ICON ecosystems.
- [POC](https://github.com/HugoByte/PoCs/tree/master/polkadot-kurtosis-poc): A minimal kurtosis package able to deploy a single node of westend and local relay chain with single parachain.

### Ecosystem Fit

With the impending core changes in Coretime, extensive testing and multiple re-deployments will be essential. This project's primary objective is to create a comprehensive deployment solution for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

This package is set to usher in a paradigm shift in parachain development. One of its standout features is its capability to create new parachains through the simple authoring of a basic configuration file. Moreover, it will not be limited to deploying just the relay chain for Polkadot and Kusama, but will also support the deployment of parachains.

This versatile package will cater to a range of node types, including validator nodes, RPC nodes, collator nodes, and archival nodes. It will further offer deployment options for both cloud and local environments, ensuring flexibility and convenience.

Kurtosis is a multi-container system that simplifies the deployment process and enables the running of multiple blockchain nodes. This feature significantly reduces the amount of time and effort required to set up nodes individually and makes the deployment process more efficient.

Moreover, the dynamic setup of nodes can be a source of errors. For instance, passing IPs or runtime-generated data between services or contracts can lead to errors during the setup. Kurtosis eliminates these issues, making the deployment process more reliable and error-free.

By implementing Kurtosis, errors during deployment can be reduced, and it becomes easier to set up environments for development and testing purposes. It streamlines the entire process, allowing developers to focus on other essential tasks and enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Why use Kurtosis?

Developers usually set up dynamic environments with a free-form scripting language like bash or Python, interacting with the Docker CLI or Docker Compose. Kurtosis is designed to make these setups easier to maintain and reuse in different test scenarios.

In Kurtosis, test environments have these properties:

- Environment-level portability: the entire test environment always runs the same way, regardless of the host machine.  
- Composability: environments can be composed and connected without needing to know the inner details of each setup.  
- Parameterizability: environments can be parameterized, so that theyâ€™re easy to modify for use across different test scenarios.

Kurtosis aims to bring DevOps back, by providing the developer with a single platform for prototyping, testing, debugging, deploying to Prod, and observing the live system.
